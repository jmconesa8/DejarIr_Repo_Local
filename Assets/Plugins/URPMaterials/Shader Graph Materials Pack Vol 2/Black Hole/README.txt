This shader uses an exposed parametrised point parameter which you can change using "material.SetVector("_Param_Name", Vector3);"
 or you can uncheck the exposed checkbox to make it the same value accross all materials and use "Shader.SetGlobalVector("_Param_Name", Vector3);"
 from a C# script.

There are two shaders in the folder one would suck all vertices into the point, and the other would shrink the object
 while it is being sucked to the point.
